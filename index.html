<!-- 
a random letter is chosen that the user will guess
user will guess (press) a key to see if they have chosen the correct letter
the user will get 13 tries to guess the right number
if they do - user wins one point
if they do not - log the letter and count backwards to number of tries is 12
user will guess another letter -->
